### Workflow
1. **👤 User Interaction:** Users sign up, log in, and upload files.
2. **📥 Data Upload:** Files are uploaded to the FastAPI server with JWT and AES encryption for authentication.
3. **🖼 Data Extraction:** PDFs are converted to images, and tabular data is extracted using PaddleOCR.
4. **🗃 Data Storage:** Extracted data is stored in a shared SQL database.
5. **🔎 Querying:** Users can run natural language queries, processed by Gemini or ChatGPT, to get SQL queries executed on the data.
6. **📤 Data Export:** Users can export tables or query results to Excel format.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
